  <h3>Intervals</h3>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Here is the interval of a second as shown in the video:</figcaption>

  <p>At approximately 3 minutes 20 seconds in the segment, Zack gives several examples of more intervals, and here they are in the order he played them:</p>

  <h3>Tones and Semitones:</h3>

  <p>Note that using only white notes we have identified two &#39;sets&#39; of semitones.</p>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>The first semitone set is between B and C</figcaption>
    <img src="./images/9_bc_semitone.png" title="B to C Semitone">
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>The other set is between E and F</figcaption>
    <img src="./images/10_ef_semitone.png" title="E to F Semitone">
  </figure>
  <br><br>

  <p>These intervals can most clearly be seen on a keyboard because there is no black key between them - if you look back at the keyboard graphic you will see this.</p>

  <h3>The C major scale:</h3>

  <p>Knowing the difference between these tones (<strong>T</strong>) and semitones (<strong>S</strong>), allows us to derive <em>The C major Scale</em>:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="./images/11_C_Major_TTS.png" title="C Major TTS">
    <figcaption>&nbsp;C is the&nbsp;<strong>tonic&nbsp;</strong>here, and this scale is an example of a <strong>diatonic scale&nbsp;</strong>, one that has a pattern of 2 semitones and 5 tones going from one octave to the next</figcaption>
