  <h3>The C major and A minor triads</h3>
  <h4>A <em>triad</em> is a three-note chord.</h4>
  <p>Deriving the C major triad from the C major scale:</p>

  <p>Deriving the A minor triad from the A natural minor scale:</p>

  <p>Here are the two triads standing alone, C major and A minor:</p>

  <p>We can say that C major is the tonic of the C major scale, and A minor is the tonic of the A minor scale.</p>
  <p>Understanding the internal structure of the triads-major and minor:</p>

  <p>Firstly we will understand the interval between the &#39;bottom&#39; note and the &#39;top&#39; note, by breaking it down into semitones, and adding those up. For C major, it&#39;s C and G:</p>

  </figure>

  <p>This interval is a <strong>perfect fifth</strong> - an interval that spans seven semitones.  We get the same thing for A minor between A and E:</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Now we need to find the interval between the &#39;bottom&#39; and &#39;middle&#39; note of the triad of C major:</p>

  <p>...which gives us a <strong>major third</strong></p>

  And for A minor:

  <p>Here we have the <strong>minor third</strong> - smaller by one semitone, i.e. the minor third spans only 3 semitones.  It is this difference in the ‘size’ or the interval of the third that makes all the difference (perceptually) between these two chords.</p>

  Here we have all the triads as played by Zack starting at about 5 minutes in the video:

  <p>In the next segment we are going to begin looking at how these triads relate to the C major scale, starting with the&nbsp;<b>three primary chords.</p>
